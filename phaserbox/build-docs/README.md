# Phaser Box2D Plugin

Thank you for purchasing this commercial Phaser plugin. We really appreciate you supporting the Phaser community. Your purchase has helped ensure that we continue with future Phaser development. You rock!

(If for some reason you didn't buy this plugin but still have a copy of it, please [do the right thing](http://phaser.io/shop/plugins/box2d/))

This plugin allows the use of Box2D Physics natively within Phaser. It uses the [Box2D JavaScript](https://code.google.com/p/box2d-html5/) conversion by Isaac Burns as we found this to be the most up to date and fastest.

## Getting Started

This is the API documentation. You will find a complete Getting Started guide inside the *manual* directory. This will tell you how to add Box2D to your own games and get up and running.

## Examples and Demos

Inside the *examples* directory you'll find lots of examples of how to use this plugin. They cover everything from the basics to more advanced demos and games.

The examples need to be run through a local web server in order to avoid file access permission errors from your browser. You can use your own web server, or start the included web server using grunt.

Using a locally installed web server browse to the examples folder:

    examples/index.html

## Bugs?

Although we have tested this plugin extensively there may still be bugs, both within the plugin itself and the port of Box2D it uses. If you are running into issues please contact support@phaser.io with as many details as possible and we'll do our best to help.
